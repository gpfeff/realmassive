Oh no! First and foremost I’d respond to Josh promptly and apologize, and assure everyone that I’ll get to the bottom of the issue. I’d make sure to create an issue in Github tickets/Pivotal Tracker/E-Mail the team…(however communications re: bugs like this) so I’d make sure to get the word out that we have an issue and that I’ll be temporarily stashing whatever work I’m doing at the moment, in order to put out the fire.
If it’s a major issue like customers not being able to login and time is of the essence, I’d check my Git log (or whatever version control system that we are currently using) and do a hard reset to whichever last commit I made to the master/production branch that I knew was 100% working…This could potentially sacrifice any recent work I’d done, but it’s the best tried and true fix if time is absolutely of the essence.

If the problem was a bit more edge case, or for some reason I had a bit more time to be methodical about tackling the bug, I’d try and replicate the error. Is it only a certain browser spitting out the error? If so what version? Operating system? Etc. I’d Google/StackOverflow the error message I got in return and then also check my commit logs to get more of a sense of what I did recently that could potentially throw this error. Once I can successfully replicate this error, I’d use my trusty tool-kit of debugging tools (If this was Ruby, I’d use the Pry/Better Errors gem and some other tools) until I successfully fix the bug. 

Once I believe the issue is resolved, I’d close the ticket/tracker etc. and alert Josh that everything is working once again, and push to production/master if that’s what the usual protocol is, or push to whatever branch this fix was being worked on in. In order to learn from my mistake and not repeat the bug, I’d write a test that addresses whatever caused the bug (which I discovered during my debugging/research) to make sure going forward, we don’t encounter the same problem.
